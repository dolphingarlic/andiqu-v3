            Why yes, I do go to school! I'd call you a big nerd for coming to
            this website to read about my schoolwork, but who am I to judge?

            I'm a student at MIT right now, studying computation and cognition
            (course 6-9). You can read about what I do/have done in college
            here. Note that everything here is just my opinion though (for
            example, apparently most people find 14.01 fun and easy).

                  They actually initially messed up the grading of this exam
                  because they graded everything in Python 2 while we were told
                  to use Python 3. Somehow, it didn't seem odd to them that most
                  people got C's and F's...

                  mainstream 8.01 (though rotational kinematics is painful

                  I went into this class not liking chemistry because of high
                  school, but I came out as a prospective materials science
                  major. I really appreciated the breadth of content that we
                  covered - especially the transition metal chemistry that one
                  wouldn't really see in high schools.

                  The first few weeks were rough because it was quantum

                  Patti is a real force of nature, and she made biology less
                  about memorization (though there was still quite a bit of
                  that) and more about thinking about the underlying mechanisms.

                  I went into the class thinking that it would be really fun and
                  chill because that's how everyone else described it. 20
                  minutes into the first lecture though, and we're doing
                  multivariable calculus already.

                  Don't get me wrong - the content was interesting and I want to
                  minor in economics. It's just that the class is really
                  maths-heavy for a humanities class, which was jarring.

                  This was a 6-unit quantum computing class taught by a PhD
                  student over IAP. There was surprisingly little physics in
                  this class, so I wasn't completely overwhelmed.

                  Being a class involving quantum mechanics, the material was
                  hard to digest and explain, but I somewhat got the hang of it
                  by the end (although I still don't understand how Grover's
                  search algorithm is useful if it assumes you already know the

                  This was an E&M class, which I found much more intuitive and
                  interesting than classical mechanics. Learning multivariable
                  calculus before taking this class was really useful, since all
                  of Maxwell's equations were basically variants of Stokes'
                  theorem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  My one gripe with this class was the unrealistic assumptions
                  we made in our calculations (infinite solenoids, ideal
                  conductors, etc.), but this is somewhat true for all physics
                  classes I suppose.

                  I'm really glad that I took this class in my freshman spring
                  because of how ubiquitous it is. It's used everywhere in
                  machine learning, which is perfect for my career goals. Its
                  concepts are even useful in differential equations and other
                  classes like that!
                </p>

                  I feel like some concepts like the SVD could've been explained

                  overall the class was understandable and enjoyable.

                  organized. Grading was opaque, collaboration policies were
                  unclear and unhelpful for most, and the class was just a mess

                  I didn't think a literature class could be fun, but this class
                  proved me wrong. I enjoyed most of the assigned readings
                  (especially 'Candide'), and it was interesting to see how
                  different media is in other countries.

                  My favourite part of this class was when I submitted a vegan
                  manifesto as a joke essay, and Joaquin loved it. I also wrote
                  a gen-Z translation of one of the chapters in the first book
                  that we read, which was also very fun.

            I don't feel like describing each thing, so here's a simple list of
            things I am/have been involved with. You can probably read their
